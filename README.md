Sorting Visualizer is a Java-based graphical application that visually demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work in real time. Built using Java Swing, AWT, and Multithreading, the application provides an interactive and educational experience by animating sorting processes like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, and Counting Sort. Users can control the sorting speed with a slider, choose different algorithms from a dropdown, and regenerate arrays with a single click. Ideal for students and enthusiasts looking to understand sorting algorithms through visual intuition.
